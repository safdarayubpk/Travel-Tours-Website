## 🔧 **TROUBLESHOOTING DEPLOYMENT**

### Build Fails on Vercel

**Symptoms**: Red "Failed" status

**Check**:

1. View build logs in Vercel dashboard
2. Look for error messages
3. Common issues:
   - Missing dependencies: Check package.json
   - TypeScript errors: Run `npx tsc --noEmit` locally
   - Environment variables missing

**Fix**:

```bash
# Test build locally first
npm run build

# If it works locally but fails on Vercel:
# - Check Node version (should be 18+)
# - Verify all dependencies in package.json
# - Check build logs carefully
```

---

### Environment Variables Not Working

**Symptoms**: Contact form fails, analytics doesn't track

**Check**:

1. Go to Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Verify variables are set
3. Check spelling (case-sensitive!)
4. Verify values are correct

**Fix**:

```
1. Update variables in Vercel dashboard
2. Trigger a redeploy:
   - Go to Deployments tab
   - Click "..." on latest deployment
   - Click "Redeploy"
```

---

### Custom Domain Not Working

**Symptoms**: Domain doesn't resolve

**Check**:

1. DNS records configured correctly?
2. Propagation time (can take 24-48 hours)
3. Vercel shows "Valid Configuration"?

**Debug**:

```bash
# Check DNS propagation
# Visit: https://dnschecker.org
# Enter your domain
# Should see Vercel's IP: 76.76.21.21
```

---

### SSL Certificate Not Working

**Symptoms**: "Not Secure" warning

**Vercel**: SSL is automatic, usually ready within 5-10 minutes

**If issues**:

1. Wait 15-30 minutes
2. Check domain configuration
3. Verify DNS records correct
4. Contact Vercel support if persists

---

### Contact Form Not Sending Emails

**Check**:

1. RESEND_API_KEY in Vercel environment variables?
2. API key is valid (not expired)?
3. Check Vercel function logs for errors

**Debug**:

```bash
# In Vercel Dashboard:
→ Go to Logs tab
→ Filter by "/contact"
→ Look for errors
→ Common issue: API key invalid or missing
```

---

### Analytics Not Tracking

**Check**:

1. NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID in Vercel?
2. Measurement ID format correct (G-XXXXXXXXXX)?
3. Built in production mode?

**Debug**:

```
1. Visit your production site
2. F12 → Console tab

# Specification Quality Checklist: Contact Form Email Delivery

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-20  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **Pass** - Specification focuses on business needs without prescribing implementation:

- No mention of specific technologies (Resend API, etc.) in requirements section
- Describes WHAT needs to happen (email delivery) not HOW to implement it
- Written in business language (inquiries, business team, customer)
- All mandatory sections present (Requirements, Success Criteria, User Scenarios, Scope)

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **Pass** - All requirements are complete and well-defined:

- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (all reasonable defaults applied)
- Each requirement is testable with clear acceptance criteria
- Success criteria include measurable metrics (99% delivery rate, <5s response, 100 submissions/day)
- All criteria are technology-agnostic (e.g., "email delivery service" not "Resend API")
- Three primary user scenarios defined with expected outcomes
- Six edge cases identified and addressed
- Scope section clearly defines what is included/excluded
- Dependencies and 8 assumptions explicitly documented

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **Pass** - Feature is ready for planning phase:

- All P0 and P1 requirements have measurable acceptance criteria
- User scenarios cover successful delivery, failure handling, and mobile use
- Success criteria define 7 measurable outcomes without implementation details
- Specification maintains abstraction layer (no code references, no API names)

## Summary

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

All validation criteria passed. The specification:

- Is complete, unambiguous, and testable
- Focuses on user value and business outcomes
- Maintains technology independence
- Includes comprehensive success criteria and acceptance tests
- Properly scopes the feature with clear boundaries

**Recommendation**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` phase.

## Notes

- Specification avoids mentioning "Resend API" or "POST /api/contact" - these are implementation details
- Focus is on email delivery outcomes, not technical mechanisms
- Existing form functionality is well-documented, making this an enhancement specification
- Success criteria are measurable and verifiable (99% success rate, <5s delivery, etc.)
- Edge cases cover common failure scenarios (service outage, invalid input, network issues)
- No clarifications needed due to clear scope and reasonable defaults applied

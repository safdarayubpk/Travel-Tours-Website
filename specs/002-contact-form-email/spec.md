## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Must Have (P0)

1. **Email Delivery**: When a user successfully submits the contact form, an email containing the inquiry details must be delivered to the designated business email address
2. **Complete Information**: The delivered email must include all form fields: customer name, customer email address, phone number (if provided), preferred tour selection (if provided), and the message content
3. **Delivery Confirmation**: Users must receive clear feedback indicating whether their inquiry was successfully sent or if there was a delivery failure
4. **Existing Design Preservation**: All visual design, layout, and user interface elements of the contact form must remain unchanged
5. **Form Validation**: Existing form validation rules must continue to work as currently implemented

#### Should Have (P1)

1. **Professional Email Format**: The delivered email should be well-formatted, easy to read, and include all customer information in a structured manner
2. **Email Subject Line**: The email should have a descriptive subject line that clearly identifies it as a contact form inquiry
3. **Timestamp**: The email should include the date and time when the inquiry was submitted

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance

- Email delivery process must complete within 5 seconds under normal conditions
- Form submission response time (including email delivery) must complete within 10 seconds
- System must handle at least 100 form submissions per day without degradation

#### Reliability

- Email delivery must have a success rate of 99% or higher under normal conditions
- Failed deliveries must be logged and made visible to administrators
- System must gracefully handle temporary email service outages without crashing

#### Security

- Customer email addresses must not be exposed in email headers to prevent spam
- Form data must be transmitted securely during the email delivery process
- No sensitive customer information should be logged in plain text
- Email delivery endpoint does not require additional authentication (relies on server-side processing security)
- Service credentials must be stored securely in environment variables, never in source code

#### User Experience

- Success feedback must appear within 2 seconds of submission
- Error messages must be user-friendly and not expose technical details
- Form must remain usable if email delivery service is temporarily unavailable

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Flow

**Scenario 1: Successful Inquiry Submission**

1. User navigates to the Contact Us page
2. User fills out all required fields (name, email, message)
3. User optionally provides phone number and selects a tour
4. User clicks "Send Message" button
5. System validates form data
6. System sends email to business team with inquiry details
7. User sees success message: "Thank you for your inquiry! We will contact you within 24 hours."
8. Business team receives email with complete inquiry information

**Expected Outcome**: User receives confirmation, business team receives inquiry email within 5 seconds

**Scenario 2: Delivery Failure Handling**

1. User submits contact form with valid information
2. Email delivery service experiences a temporary issue
3. System attempts to send email but fails
4. User sees error message: "We couldn't send your message right now. Please try again in a few moments."
5. User can retry submission
6. Failed delivery is logged for administrator review

**Expected Outcome**: User is informed of the issue without seeing technical error details, can retry

**Scenario 3: Mobile User Inquiry**

1. Mobile user accesses Contact Us page
2. User fills out form on mobile device (portrait orientation, 375px width)
3. User submits form
4. Email is sent successfully
5. Success feedback displays appropriately on mobile screen

**Expected Outcome**: Mobile experience identical to desktop, all functionality works

### Edge Cases

1. **Incomplete Email Address**: User provides invalid email format → Existing validation catches error before submission
2. **Very Long Message**: User writes 1000+ character message → Email includes full message content, no truncation
3. **Special Characters**: User includes emojis or special characters in name/message → Email preserves all characters correctly
4. **Rapid Resubmission**: User clicks submit button multiple times quickly → Only one email is sent, duplicate prevention
5. **Service Timeout**: Email service takes longer than expected → User sees loading state, then appropriate feedback
6. **No Internet Connection**: User submits form while offline → Clear error message indicating connectivity issue

## Success Criteria

1. **Delivery Success Rate**: 99% or more of form submissions successfully deliver email to business team
2. **Response Time**: 95% of email deliveries complete within 5 seconds
3. **User Satisfaction**: Users receive clear, immediate feedback on submission status
4. **Zero Data Loss**: All submitted inquiries are either delivered via email or logged for manual follow-up
5. **Operational Visibility**: Business team can track inquiry volume and identify any delivery issues
6. **Design Consistency**: No visual changes to contact form (before/after comparison shows identical UI)
7. **Accessibility Maintained**: All existing accessibility features continue to function (keyboard navigation, screen readers, ARIA labels)

## Assumptions

1. **Recipient Email Address**: All contact form inquiries will be delivered to safdarayub@gmail.com
2. **Sender Email Address**: Emails will be sent from "Travel & Tours <onboarding@resend.dev>"
3. **Email Service Availability**: An email delivery service is available and configured for use
4. **Service Credentials**: API credentials are securely stored in environment variables (`.env` file)
5. **No Reply-To Setup**: The delivered emails do not need to support direct reply-to-customer functionality (manual follow-up is acceptable)
6. **Single Recipient**: All inquiries go to one email address; no routing or distribution logic needed
7. **No Authentication Required**: The email delivery mechanism does not require additional endpoint authentication beyond server-side security
8. **English Language**: All form content and emails are in English; no multi-language support required
9. **No Attachments**: Contact form does not support file attachments; plain text and form fields only
10. **Existing Infrastructure**: The application already has server-side processing capability (Server Actions)
11. **Modern Browsers**: Users access the form via modern web browsers that support current web standards

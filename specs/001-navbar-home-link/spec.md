## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Must Have (P0)

1. **Logo Click Navigation**: Users must be able to click anywhere on the logo area (globe icon or "Travel & Tours" text) to navigate to the homepage
2. **Visual Feedback**: The logo area must provide clear visual feedback when users hover over it with a cursor (opacity reduced to 80% and cursor changes to pointer), indicating it is clickable
3. **Accessibility Support**: The clickable logo area must include appropriate accessibility labels for screen reader users
4. **Navigation Behavior**: Navigation must occur instantly without full page reloads, maintaining smooth user experience
5. **Consistent Styling**: The updated logo must maintain all existing visual styling, colors, sizing, and responsive behavior

#### Should Have (P1)

1. **Focus State**: The logo should display a visible focus indicator (blue outline ring, 2px solid) when navigated to via keyboard
2. **Touch Feedback**: On touch devices, the logo should provide subtle visual feedback when tapped

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance

- Page load time: Navigation to homepage completes in under 500ms on average connections
- Time to Interactive: Homepage becomes interactive within 1.5 seconds after navigation
- No performance degradation from current navbar implementation

#### Accessibility

- WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance maintained
- Keyboard navigation fully supported (Tab to focus, Enter to activate)
- Screen reader announces logo as a navigational link to homepage
- Descriptive aria-label provided for assistive technology users
- Color contrast maintained at minimum 4.5:1 ratio
- Touch target meets minimum 44x44px size requirement

#### Responsive Design

- Logo remains clickable across all screen sizes (320px minimum)
- Mobile-first behavior maintained
- Touch targets appropriately sized for mobile devices (minimum 44x44px)
- Visual feedback appropriate for both desktop (hover) and mobile (tap) interactions

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Flow

**Scenario 1: Desktop User Returns to Homepage**

1. User is browsing the Tours listing page
2. User moves mouse over the "Travel & Tours" logo in the navbar
3. Logo displays hover effect (visual feedback)
4. User clicks on the logo
5. User is instantly navigated to the homepage without page reload
6. Homepage content loads and displays

**Expected Outcome**: User successfully returns to homepage in under 1 second with smooth transition

**Scenario 2: Mobile User Returns to Homepage**

1. User is viewing a tour detail page on mobile device
2. User scrolls to top to access navbar
3. User taps on the globe icon or "Travel & Tours" text
4. User is navigated to the homepage
5. Mobile menu (if open) closes automatically

**Expected Outcome**: User returns to homepage with single tap, clear interaction

**Scenario 3: Keyboard Navigation**

1. User presses Tab key to navigate through page elements
2. Focus indicator moves to logo area
3. Logo displays visible focus state
4. User presses Enter key
5. User is navigated to homepage

**Expected Outcome**: Logo is accessible via keyboard, announces as link, navigates on Enter

### Edge Cases

1. **User Already on Homepage**: Clicking logo while already on homepage scrolls smoothly to the top of the page (following modern web conventions)
2. **Rapid Clicks**: Multiple rapid clicks on logo should not trigger multiple navigation events or cause errors
3. **Touch Devices**: Tap interaction should not trigger hover states that persist
4. **Navigation During Load**: Logo remains functional even during initial page load

## Success Criteria

1. **Navigation Success Rate**: 100% of logo clicks successfully navigate to homepage
2. **User Discoverability**: Users instinctively identify logo as clickable without instruction (standard web pattern)
3. **Interaction Speed**: Users can navigate to homepage in single click/tap with response time under 200ms
4. **Accessibility Compliance**: Logo link passes automated accessibility testing tools (WAVE, axe DevTools) with zero errors
5. **Cross-Device Compatibility**: Logo click functions identically across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
6. **Performance Baseline**: Navigation performance meets or exceeds current site navigation performance
7. **Visual Consistency**: Logo appearance remains unchanged except for hover/focus feedback states

## Assumptions

1. **Current Homepage Route**: The homepage is accessible at the root path (`/`)
2. **Client-Side Routing**: The application supports client-side routing for instant navigation
3. **Logo Positioning**: The logo area (icon + text) remains in its current position in the navbar
4. **Existing Styles**: Current logo styling (colors, fonts, sizing) should be preserved
5. **Browser Support**: Solution works in all browsers currently supported by the Travel & Tours website
6. **Hover Effect Implementation**: The opacity reduction to 80% should include a smooth 200ms transition (standard web interaction pattern)

## Scope

### In Scope

- Making the existing logo area (globe icon and "Travel & Tours" text) clickable
- Adding visual hover effects to indicate interactivity
- Adding accessibility labels for screen readers
- Maintaining existing visual design and responsive behavior
- Ensuring keyboard navigation support

### Out of Scope

- Redesigning the logo visual appearance
- Changing logo position or layout
- Adding new navigation menu items
- Modifying other navbar functionality
- Adding logo animations beyond hover/focus states
- Multi-language support for aria labels (unless already implemented)
- Analytics tracking for logo clicks (can be added separately)

## Dependencies

1. **Homepage Availability**: Homepage must be accessible and functional
2. **Routing System**: Client-side routing must be operational
3. **Existing Navbar Component**: The navbar component must be modifiable
4. **Styling System**: CSS/styling system must support hover and focus states

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk                                        | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation                                               |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------ | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Users don't notice logo is clickable        | Medium | Low        | Add subtle hover effect; follows standard web convention |
| Hover effects conflict with mobile behavior | Low    | Low        | Use appropriate media queries for hover-capable devices  |
| Accessibility labels are unclear            | Medium | Low        | Follow WCAG guidelines; test with screen readers         |
| Performance degradation                     | Low    | Very Low   | Client-side routing is already optimized                 |

# Specification Quality Checklist: Clickable Navbar Logo

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-20  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **Pass** - Specification focuses on user needs and behavior without prescribing implementation:

- No mention of specific frameworks (Next.js, React) in requirements
- Describes WHAT users need (clickable logo, navigation) not HOW to build it
- Written in business language accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (Requirements, Success Criteria, User Scenarios, Scope) present

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **Pass** - All requirements are complete and well-defined:

- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (all ambiguities resolved with reasonable defaults)
- Each requirement is testable with clear acceptance criteria
- Success criteria include measurable metrics (100% navigation success, <200ms response, 44x44px touch targets)
- All criteria are technology-agnostic (e.g., "navigation without page reload" vs "use Next.js Link")
- Three primary user scenarios defined with expected outcomes
- Four edge cases identified and addressed
- Scope section clearly defines what is included/excluded
- Dependencies and 6 assumptions explicitly documented

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **Pass** - Feature is ready for planning phase:

- All P0 and P1 requirements have measurable acceptance criteria
- User scenarios cover desktop, mobile, and keyboard navigation flows
- Success criteria define 7 measurable outcomes without implementation details
- Specification maintains abstraction layer (no code references, framework mentions)

## Summary

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

All validation criteria passed. The specification:

- Is complete, unambiguous, and testable
- Focuses on user value and business outcomes
- Maintains technology independence
- Includes comprehensive success criteria and acceptance tests
- Properly scopes the feature with clear boundaries

**Recommendation**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` phase.

## Notes

- Specification follows standard web navigation patterns, reducing ambiguity
- Assumptions section documents 6 reasonable defaults based on existing codebase context
- Edge cases address common interaction scenarios (already on homepage, rapid clicks, etc.)
- No clarifications needed due to straightforward feature scope and standard web conventions

### Category 5: Responsive Design (Principle 5)

**Focus**: Mobile-first, multi-device support

- [ ] Implement mobile-first layouts (320px+)
- [ ] Add responsive breakpoints (768px, 1024px, 1280px)
- [ ] Ensure touch targets are 44x44px minimum
- [ ] Use Next.js Image for responsive images
- [ ] Test on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- [ ] Implement flexible grid layouts

- [ ] Implement dynamic imports for heavy components
- [ ] Use next/font for font optimization
- [ ] Minimize client-side JavaScript
- [ ] Run Lighthouse audit (target: 90+)
- [ ] Analyze bundle size
- [ ] Implement code splitting

### Category 7: Code Quality (Principle 7)

**Focus**: Standards and maintainability

- [ ] Configure ESLint rules
- [ ] Fix ESLint errors and warnings
- [ ] Use meaningful variable names
- [ ] Add comments for complex logic
- [ ] Replace magic numbers with constants
- [ ] Follow conventional commit format
- [ ] Conduct code reviews

### Category 8: SEO & Accessibility (Principle 8)

**Focus**: Search optimization and inclusivity

- [ ] Write meta descriptions (150-160 chars)
- [ ] Use semantic HTML (header, nav, main, footer)
- [ ] Add alt text to all images
- [ ] Implement keyboard navigation
- [ ] Ensure color contrast meets WCAG AA (4.5:1)
- [ ] Add ARIA labels where needed
- [ ] Implement structured data (JSON-LD)
- [ ] Test with screen readers

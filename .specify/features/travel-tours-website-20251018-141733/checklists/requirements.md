# Specification Quality Checklist: Travel & Tours Website

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-18  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**: Specification successfully avoids implementation details and focuses on WHAT and WHY. Component hierarchy shows logical structure without technology specifics.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes**: All requirements clearly defined with specific, measurable outcomes. Success criteria focus on user-facing metrics (load times, engagement, completion rates) rather than technical implementations.

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes**: Four primary user flows documented with step-by-step scenarios. Eight edge cases identified. 12 measurable success criteria defined (engagement time, performance scores, completion rates, etc.).

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ **PASSED** - All quality checks satisfied

**Specification Quality Score**: 100%

- Content Quality: 4/4 ✅
- Requirement Completeness: 8/8 ✅
- Feature Readiness: 4/4 ✅

**Total Items**: 16/16 passed

## Readiness Assessment

✅ **Ready for Planning Phase** (`/speckit.plan`)

The specification is complete, unambiguous, and technology-agnostic. All requirements are testable with clear acceptance criteria. No clarifications needed.

### Strengths

1. **Comprehensive User Flows** - Four detailed user scenarios covering all primary use cases
2. **Measurable Success Criteria** - 12 specific, quantifiable outcomes defined
3. **Clear Scope Boundaries** - P0, P1, P2 requirements clearly prioritized
4. **Edge Cases Documented** - 8 error scenarios identified upfront
5. **Well-Defined Entities** - Tour and Contact Inquiry entities clearly specified
6. **Detailed Page Layouts** - Visual structure for all 4 pages documented
7. **Realistic Assumptions** - 10 reasonable assumptions documented for implementation decisions

### Next Steps

1. Run `/speckit.plan` to create implementation plan
2. Review plan against constitutional principles
3. Begin development following Next.js App Router best practices

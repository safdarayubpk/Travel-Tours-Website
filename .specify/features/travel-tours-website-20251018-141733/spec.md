## Key Entities

### Tour Entity

A tour represents a complete travel package with the following information:

- **Tour ID** - Unique identifier for internal reference
- **Slug** - URL-friendly identifier for routing (e.g., "paris-adventure", "tokyo-explorer")
- **Destination Name** - City or primary location (e.g., "Paris Adventure", "Tokyo Explorer")
- **Country** - Country where tour takes place
- **Price** - Cost per person (base price, currency specified)
- **Duration** - Length of tour in days and nights (e.g., "7 days, 6 nights")
- **Description** - Short overview (1-2 paragraphs) highlighting key experiences
- **Extended Description** - Detailed itinerary and what's included
- **Image(s)** - One or more high-quality photographs of destination
- **Category** - Region or tour type (Europe, Asia, Americas, Africa, etc.)
- **Featured Status** - Boolean indicating if tour appears on homepage (3-6 featured tours)

**URL Pattern**: Tour detail pages use slug-based routing at `/tours/[slug]` (e.g., `/tours/paris-adventure`) for SEO-friendly, readable URLs.

**Data Volume**: The demonstration site will include 12-15 sample tours distributed across 4 major regions (3-4 tours per region: Europe, Asia, Americas, Africa) to meaningfully demonstrate filtering and browsing functionality.

A contact inquiry captures information when a user submits the contact form:

- **Name** - User's full name

## Assumptions

1. **Project Purpose** - This is a demonstration/portfolio project focused on showcasing layout design, routing patterns, and reusable component architecture rather than production deployment
2. **Tour Data Source** - Sample/mock tour data is sufficient; can be hardcoded, JSON file, or simple data structure for demonstration purposes
3. **Contact Form Handling** - Form submissions will use Next.js 15 Server Actions with simulated processing (demonstrating progressive enhancement and modern form handling patterns); actual email delivery not required
4. **Currency Display** - Prices displayed in USD by default (multi-currency can be added in future versions)
5. **Tour Availability** - All displayed tours are assumed available; real-time availability checking not required for v1.0
6. **Image Assets** - High-quality tour images will be sourced from approved stock photo libraries or placeholder services for demonstration
7. **Content Management** - Tour content will be managed by developers initially (CMS integration deferred to future version)
8. **Language Support** - Website will be in English only for initial version
9. **Geographic Scope** - "International tours" refers to tours outside the user's home country (assumed primarily targeting North American audience)
10. **Price Inclusions** - Price represents base per-person cost; detailed inclusions/exclusions listed in tour description
11. **Code Quality Focus** - Emphasis on clean code architecture, component reusability, proper TypeScript typing, and demonstrating Next.js App Router best practices
12. **Component Organization** - Feature-based folder structure with shadcn/ui components in `/components/ui`, tour-related components in `/components/tours`, contact components in `/components/contact`, and shared layout components at root `/components` level

## Dependencies & Blockers

**Dependencies:**

- Sample tour data (can be mock data for demonstration)
- Stock photo libraries or placeholder images for tours
- Optional: Design inspiration for modern travel website aesthetics

**Blockers:**

- None identified at specification stage (demonstration nature reduces external dependencies)

## Timeline Estimate

- **Design Phase**: 3-5 days (mockups and design system)
- **Development Phase**: 10-15 days (component development, pages, integration)
- **Testing Phase**: 3-5 days (cross-browser, accessibility, performance)
- **Content Population**: 2-3 days (adding tour data and images)
- **Deployment**: 1 day

**Total Estimate**: 3-4 weeks from design start to production deployment
